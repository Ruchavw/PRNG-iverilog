# Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)

**Design Component:** 4-Bit Register 

**Operations Performed:** Shift-Left, Shift-Right, and Complementation Operations

## OVERVIEW

This project explores the design and implementation of
Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG) using a shift-left, shift-
right, & complementation operations for 4-bit register (universal
shift register with complementation instead of parallel loading). By
using the architecture of Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs)
which is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its
previous state. The system uses a 4-bit universal shift register to
produce a sequence of pseudorandom values driven by a defined
feedback polynomial that generates new bits based on the current
state of the register. The complementation provides additional
versatility to manipulate the output.
This provides an example of application of digital circuit
techniques to generate randomness which plays a vital role in
domains like cryptography, data encryption, simulations and
randomized algorithms. Through this project, we can show the
effectiveness of shift registers in generating high-quality
pseudorandom sequences in hardware applications.
